    "Correlation coefficient tells us the extent to which variables are related. `Correlation matrix` is a tool to calculate and visualize the correlation coefficients among the variables of interest. The most striking observation is the correlation coefficient of 76% between Comcast and S&P-500 indicating that there is a high correlation between these two variables. However, it is not the case for AT&T and Verizon whose correlation coefficients with S&P-500 are -52% and 55%, respectively."

This estimated beta coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level since we have a t-value of 6.847 (or p-value of 0.0000). However, the intercept term is not statistically significant.

The beta coefficient of 0.4899 implies that there is a correlation between excess market return and excess return of the IBM. More specifically, 1-unit increase in S&P-500 leads to an increase in IBM return by nearly 0.4899. The result also suggests that the IBM is less risky than market index.  Again, the intercept term is not statistically significant at conventional confidence interval."
